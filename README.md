# CodeAlpha-CyberSecurity 

I presented here a summary of the tasks I did during my Cybersecurity Internship at Code Alpha.

## Task1
The objective is to inform and empower individuals regarding phishing attacks, enabling them to identify and circumvent deceptive emails, websites, and social engineering strategies. This knowledge is essential for enhancing personal cybersecurity and protecting sensitive information.

## Task2
I was given to build a network sniffer in Python that captures and analyses netrwork traffic. This essentially help me to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.
## Task3
I was assigned to review the code of an application for security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.
